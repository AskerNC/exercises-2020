Notes on problems:

2.1
use ** to raise to the power of

2.2
f-strings
experimentation is key 

2.3

Extra question: why are the contours squared, when the utility function is continous?



2.4
Use the internet!:
Numpy has sinus functions 

3. looks complecated, but in its essence it just a multi-dimensional version of problem 2.4
x_max might trow some people of, the x1-x5's inside the loop is the share of maximum possible
